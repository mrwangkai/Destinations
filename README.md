Destinations
============

A static page with a list of places I have been to.

Goal:
- practice coding (responsive web design, javascript)
- recount the places I have been to
- design interactions, and execute them

Future developments:
- horizontal scrolling style browsing of locations
- consider responsiveness of the design
